- The field map is still not working and showing when someone is on base??  This worked at one time.
- The modal that shows when you click on the team name in the Scoreboard shows 0 for all values.
- Pitch box sometimes shows pitches outside of the pitchbox.   Set overflow to make sure this doesnt happen.
